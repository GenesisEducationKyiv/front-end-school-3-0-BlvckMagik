## Zero-Day Vulnerability Check
All packages have been checked against the following vulnerability databases:
- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- GitHub Security Advisories
- npm Security Advisories
- Snyk Vulnerability Database

Two known vulnerabilities were found in the brace-expansion package, which is a transitive dependency of multiple packages. No zero-day vulnerabilities were found in any of the direct dependencies.

## Package Replacement Analysis

### Proposed Replacement: `axios` → `ky`

#### Current Package: axios
- Version: ^1.8.4
- Security Status: ✅ Secure
- Known for: HTTP client with wide browser support

#### Proposed Alternative: ky
- Latest Version: 1.0.0
- Security Status: ✅ Secure
- Advantages:
  1. Built on top of the Fetch API
  2. Smaller bundle size
  3. Modern Promise-based API
  4. Better TypeScript support
  5. Automatic retries
  6. Timeout handling
  7. URL prefixing
  8. JSON handling

#### Security Analysis Steps for ky:
1. Checked GitHub Security Advisories - No known vulnerabilities
2. Verified through pnpm audit - No security issues
3. Reviewed dependency tree - All sub-dependencies are secure
4. Checked for known CVEs - No reported vulnerabilities
5. Verified through Snyk - No security vulnerabilities

#### Migration Steps:
1. Install ky:
   ```bash
   pnpm add ky
   ```
2. Replace axios imports with ky
3. Update API calls to use ky's Promise-based API
4. Update error handling to match ky's error structure
5. Update TypeScript types if necessary

## Immediate Action Required
1. Update brace-expansion to version 2.0.2 or later
2. Update the following packages to versions that use the patched brace-expansion:
   - @eslint/eslintrc
   - @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
   - eslint-config-next
3. Run `pnpm install` to update the lockfile
4. Run `pnpm audit` to verify the fixes
5. Run `snyk test` to verify the fixes

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Implement automated dependency updates using tools like Dependabot or Renovate
2. **Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipeline
3. **Version Pinning**: Consider using exact versions for critical dependencies
4. **Audit Frequency**: Conduct security audits quarterly
5. **Documentation**: Keep this security report updated with each major dependency change
6. **Transitive Dependencies**: Regularly check and update transitive dependencies
7. **Multiple Audit Tools**: Use multiple security scanning tools (Snyk, pnpm audit, Dependabot) for comprehensive coverage

## Conclusion
While most dependencies are secure and up-to-date, there are two known vulnerabilities in the brace-expansion package that need to be addressed. The vulnerabilities are in transitive dependencies and require updating multiple packages to ensure all instances of brace-expansion are updated to the patched version. The severity of these vulnerabilities is rated as low, but they should still be addressed to maintain a secure codebase.
