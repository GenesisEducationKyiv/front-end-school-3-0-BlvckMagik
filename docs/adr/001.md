# ADR 001: Transition to Feature Sliced Design Architecture

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Currently, our React application follows a traditional component-based architecture where components, contexts, and other code artifacts are grouped by their technical role (components, contexts, lib, etc.). This structure becomes harder to maintain as the application grows, making it difficult to:

- Understand feature boundaries
- Manage dependencies between features
- Scale the application effectively
- Onboard new developers
- Implement new features without affecting existing ones

The current structure:
src/
components/
contexts/
lib/
types/
app/

## Decision

We will adopt Feature Sliced Design (FSD) architecture to organize our codebase. The new structure will be:

src/\
├── entities/\
├────track/\
├────player/\
├── features/\
├────trackManagement/\
├────audioPlayback/\
├────trackFiltering/\
├── widgets/\
├────trackList/\
├────audioPlayer/\
├── shared/\
├────ui/\
├────api/\
├────lib/\
└────types/\

### Key Principles

1. **Layers**:

   - `entities`: Business objects (Track, Player)
   - `features`: User interactions and business logic
   - `widgets`: Composite components combining entities and features
   - `shared`: Reusable components and utilities
   - `app`: Global providers and configurations

2. **Slice Independence**: Each slice (feature, entity) should be independent and self-contained

3. **Public API**: Each slice should expose a clear public API through index files

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear feature boundaries and responsibilities
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Improved reusability of components
- Better scalability
- Clearer dependency management
- Easier to implement new features

### Negative

- Initial time investment for restructuring
- Learning curve for team members
- Need to refactor existing components
- Potential temporary increase in complexity during transition

## Implementation Plan

1. Create new directory structure
2. Move existing components to appropriate slices:

   - Move track-related components to `entities/track`
   - Move audio player to `entities/player`
   - Move track management to `features/trackManagement`
   - Move filtering/sorting to `features/trackFiltering`
   - Move shared components to `shared/ui`

3. Update imports and dependencies

4. Example refactoring:

```typescript
// Before: src/components/tracks/TrackItem.tsx
// After: src/entities/track/ui/TrackItem.tsx

// Before: src/contexts/AudioPlayerContext.tsx
// After: src/entities/player/model/AudioPlayerContext.tsx

// Before: src/components/tracks/CreateTrackModal.tsx
// After: src/features/trackManagement/ui/CreateTrackModal.tsx
```
